# Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Train Demo
We provide training demo for TESS dataset in the `train_downstream_demo` folder. You can modify the scripts to train your downstream model on other datasets.

## Training Data Preprocessing
1. Add your training dataset

Convert the training `.wav` or `.mp4` files into `.npy` format, run:
```python
python /your/path/to/scripts/extract_features_batch.sh
```
2. Obtain the `.emo` file

Convert the `json` file of training data into `.emo` format, run:
```python
python /your/path/to/scripts/json_to_emo.sh
```
3. Obtain the `.dann` and `.length`

After obtaining the `.npy` features and the corresponding `.emo` files, run:
```python
python /your/path/to/train_downstream_demo/pack_tess_fea.py
```

If you want to train a DANN model, additionally run:
```python 
python /your/path/to/train_downstream_demo/add_dann_para.py
```
4. Mix all training datasets:

Mix all datasets for downstream training, run:
```python 
python /your/path/to/downstream/final_mix_all.py
```
You will obtain the data format like `/downstream/Final_mix_demo` for the subsequent training.

## Training your downstream model
We provide a training data format demo for TESS dataset in `/downstream/Final_mix_demo` folder. 
Based on this format, you can reproduce the experimental results with the same datasets presented in the paper.

1. Train a SER model, run:
```python
python /your/path/to/downstream/final_train.sh
```
2. Train a DANN model, run:
```python
python /your/path/to/downstream/train_DANN_balenced.sh
```
3. Probe experiments, run:
```python
python /your/path/to/downstream/probe_train.sh
```
The training results will be saved in `/downstream/outputs` folder

# Evaluation Demo
We provide a evaluatino demo in `/downstream/batch_test` folder.

Testing a SER model, run:
```python
python /your/path/to/downstream/batch_test/EVAL.py
```

DANN model evaluation, run:
```python
python /your/path/to/downstream/batch_test/EVAL_DANN.py
```

Probe experiments evaluation, run:
```python
python /your/path/to/downstream/batch_test/EVAL_probe_emotion.py
```

# Visualization
If you want to observe the distribution of the features after T-SNE dimensionality reduction, run:
```python
python /your/path/to/downstream/visualize/visualize.py
```
